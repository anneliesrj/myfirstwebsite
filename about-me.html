        <div class="grid-item"><h3>About me</h3><p><b>Hi!</b> I'm Annelies. Thank you for visiting my website. 
            <br>Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I was born in the Netherlands and have lived there most of my life. In late 2019 I moved to the UK to move in with my partner. 
            <br><br>Right before the COVID outbreak, I found a job in education in a support role. I knew this was not the long-term job for me, but I was happy to have a job and income during the difficult 2 years. Last year I followed a course in Counselling and was thinking about continuing further education in Counselling. When I was accepted on a university course, I started doubting this decision and was thinking back about the other thing I always thought I might like and would be good at; <b>coding</b>.
            <br><br> And here I am! Writing code and creating websites. 2 months in now, and I am very happy with this decision. Hopefully this time next year, I will have a new job in software development/engineering.

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>

        <h4 class="question"> - Where are you from?</h4>
        <div class="answer">I'm from the Netherlands!</div>

        <h4 class="question"> - Why do you live in the UK?</h4>
        <div class="answer">I've moved to the UK a bit more than 3 years ago for love.</div>

        <h4 class="question"> - What is your current job?</h4>
        <div class="answer">At the moment I am a Learning Support Assistant in a high school!</div>
        
        <h4 class="question"> - Why coding?</h4>
        <div class="answer">When I was younger, I always liked Maths, technology, and languages. I never thought I could put these together to do 
            something that contains all these qualities and get a job using this. It just took me some time to figure this out, but here I am. 
            I finally realized that coding is probably a good career for me, something I enjoy and keeps challenging me. 
            I tend to get bored in jobs where you keep doing the same processes. I'm certain that coding is different!</div>
        
        <h4 class="question"> - Do you have a cat?</h4>
